# About Project

This project is inspired by [@demscr3ation](https://twitter.com/demscr3ations). I came across his UI design on [twitter](https://twitter.com) and felt the desire to bring it to life. I reached out to him immediately and this project is the result of our conversation.

## Technologies Used

- React JS
- TailwindCSS

## Creating the Project

I have come to agree that the best and most effective way to learn something is by actually putting it to practice. In order to see this project through completion, I found myself learning, unlearning and having to relearn some forgotten concepts. <br>

One area that particularly caught my focus was implementing the concept of writing good and maintanable code by strictly adhering to the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and also implementing security best practices.<br>

## Conclusion
I hope to carry on and build upon this project in the nearest future. I intend to refine it and make it a full-stack web application. I've chosen to keep the detail scripted until after project completion. I, however, dedicate this project to every curious student of education looking to improve his/her skill coding skill.
